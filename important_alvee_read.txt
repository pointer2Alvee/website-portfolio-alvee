* SEE TUTORIAL IF YOU CANT UNDERSTAND OR ChatGPT HELP
* STEPS :-
0) Install npm, nextjs, tailwind and necessary tools using cmd or vs code terminal (preferred)
after that:-
1) open project in VS code
2) start terminal
3) type command : npm run dev
4) browser : localhost:3000 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IN vs code terminal originally : npx --version or npm -v
the npx an npm commands are not recognized and shows error
although properly installed. But shows in windows powershell properly. 
this is due to execution policy

--> Solution in VS code terminal :
 
Option 1: Change Execution Policy in VS Code
Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
CurrentUser ensures the change applies only to your user account.
RemoteSigned allows scripts you create to run and blocks unsigned scripts from the internet.

*Run the following command to set the execution policy for the current user:-
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
TYPE : Y

*should work :-
npx --version

*Revert the Policy (Optional)
If you want to revert the policy to its original state after running your commands:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted
